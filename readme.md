YelpCamp is a mock website that is modeled after Yelp. It uses a lot of the same features as Yelp such as
* Ability to signip and login
* Post campsites on the site
* Modify your post with various information
* Comment on other posts

All of these features depend on the the user being logged in. Using advanced user authentication to make it all happen!

Most of these this data is stored on a database created using MongoDB, along with Express.js
